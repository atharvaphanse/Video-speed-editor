# Video-Speed-Editor
Speed-up or slow-down a video using OpenCV

With just few lines of python code you can change the speed of a video. Just define the desired FPS (frames per second). 
 
DISCLAIMER: I have only used this on simple videos with only few MBs in size. But this will certainly be helpful for editing animated graphs/ simulations created with python etc
